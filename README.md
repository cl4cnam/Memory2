# Memory2

Find 3 (or 4,5,6) identical cards.

Here is just a little memory card game.
Unlike classical Memory, this game is not limited to pairs, but you might have to find up to sixsomes (six identical cards). 

This concentration card game is made with [FuncSug](https://github.com/cl4cnam/funcSug).

You can test it [here](https://cl4cnam.github.io/Memory2/memory.html).
